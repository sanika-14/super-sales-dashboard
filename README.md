# super-sales-dashboard
⭐ The dataset that was used was a super store sales data. It had labels like shipping date, delivery date, profit, region and many more. 

⭐ I also developed a sales forecasting page that showcases forecasts for the next 15 days. 

⭐ The visualization consists of maps, line graphs and donut charts that showcase the Sales description based on various factors. 

⭐The map visualization consists of United States divided into four sub-regions. The profit sales of any sub-region can be visualized through this.

⭐ With this visualization, I was able to gain understanding on forecasting of data through Power BI.
